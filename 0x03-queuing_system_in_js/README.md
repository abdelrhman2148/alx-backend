### README for "0x03. Queuing System in JS"  

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Redis-based queuing system using Node.js, Express.js, and Kue. You will learn to manage asynchronous tasks, store data in Redis, and build basic queuing applications. The project involves using Redis as a database and job queue, interacting with it programmatically, and implementing functionality for creating, processing, and tracking jobs.

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Set up and run a Redis server on your local machine.
- Perform basic operations using the Redis client.
- Use a Redis client with Node.js for advanced functionality.
- Store and retrieve hash values in Redis.
- Work with async operations using Redis and Node.js.
- Implement a job queue system using Kue.
- Build a basic Express app interacting with Redis.
- Track progress and handle errors for queued jobs.

### Requirements
- **Environment:** 
  - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  - Node.js 12.x
  - Redis 5.0.7 or higher
- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Mandatory Files:**
  - `package.json`
  - `.babelrc`
  - `README.md` (this file)
- **Dependencies:** Install required modules using `$ npm install`.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Redis:**
   ```bash
   wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
   tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
   cd redis-6.0.10
   make
   src/redis-server &
   ```

2. **Verify Redis is Working:**
   ```bash
   src/redis-cli ping
   ```
   Expected response: `PONG`

3. **Project Setup:**
   - Clone the repository:  
     `git clone <repository_url>`
   - Navigate to the project directory:  
     `cd 0x03-queuing_system_in_js`
   - Install dependencies:  
     `npm install`

4. **Run Redis Client Tests:**
   - Start Redis server:  
     `src/redis-server &`
   - Run scripts with Babel:  
     `npm run dev <filename.js>`

### Features and Task Breakdown
Each task focuses on a different aspect of Redis and job queues.

1. **Redis Basics:**  
   Connect to Redis, perform basic operations, and confirm functionality.

2. **Node.js and Redis Client Integration:**  
   Write scripts to interact with Redis using callbacks and Promises.

3. **Redis Hash Operations:**  
   Store and retrieve hash values in Redis for more structured data.

4. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern:**  
   Build a pub-sub system with Redis to handle message broadcasting.

5. **Job Creation and Processing:**  
   Use Kue to create and process jobs, demonstrating a real-world queuing system.

6. **Job Tracking and Error Handling:**  
   Track progress and handle errors using Kue's built-in functionality.

7. **Web Integration:**  
   Use Express to expose APIs for interacting with Redis-backed data.

---

### How to Run
1. **Start Redis Server:**
   ```bash
   src/redis-server &
   ```

2. **Run Scripts:**
   Use Babel to execute scripts. Example:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev 0-redis_client.js
   ```

3. **Test API Endpoints (for web tasks):**
   Start the Express server and test endpoints using `curl` or Postman.
